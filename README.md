## Overview
üéß Binaural Audio Generation (BAG)
CCStereo tackles the task of generating spatialised binaural audio from monaural audio using corresponding visual cues, enabling immersive sound experiences for applications in VR, AR, and 360¬∞ video.

üß† Context-Aware Audio-Visual Conditioning
Existing BAG methods rely heavily on cross-attention mechanisms and often fail to leverage the rich temporal and spatial dynamics present in video. CCStereo introduces Audio-Visual Adaptive De-normalisation (AVAD) layers to modulate the decoding process with spatial and semantic information derived from video frames, offering finer-grained control.

üîç Spatial-Aware Contrastive Learning
To improve spatial sensitivity, CCStereo uses a novel contrastive learning framework that mines hard negatives by applying spatial shuffling and temporal frame sampling, effectively simulating object position changes and encouraging the model to distinguish fine-grained spatial relationships in the audio-visual space.

üß™ Test-Time Augmentation without Overhead
Unlike prior methods that ignore the inherent redundancy of video data, CCStereo introduces Test-time Dynamic Scene Simulation (TDSS)‚Äîa sliding-window based augmentation strategy that crops frames from multiple regions (top-left, center, etc.) without increasing inference cost, boosting robustness and spatial accuracy.

## Highlights

**CCStereo** converts monaural audio to binaural audio using visual input. It addresses key limitations in spatial alignment and generalisation using:

- **AVAD**: Audio-Visual Adaptive De-normalisation for feature modulation.
- **SCL**: Spatial-aware Contrastive Learning for learning spatial correspondence.
- **TDSS**: Test-time Dynamic Scene Simulation for augmentation without added cost.
